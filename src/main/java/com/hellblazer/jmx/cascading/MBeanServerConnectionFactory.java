 * An object that is able to return connections to a given MBeanServer. The
 * MBeanServer could be local ({@link LocalMBeanServerConnectionFactory}) or
 * remote ({@link BasicMBeanServerConnectionFactory}).
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the {@link MBeanServerConnectionFactory} may or may not
 * support transparent reconnection when the underlying connection is abruptly
 * closed (server going down, network failure, etc...). Whether transparent
 * reconnection is supported or not should be transparent to the client code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If transparent reconnection is supported, then the
 * {@link MBeanServerConnectionFactory} implementation is responsible for
 * transparently initiating a new connection with the server side, by, e.g,
 * obtaining a new <code>JMXConnector</code> from a lookup service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link MBeanServerConnectionFactory} emits
 * {@link JMXConnectionNotification} relating to the underlying connection:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link JMXConnectionNotification#OPENED}: The connection with the
 * underlying MBeanServer was (re)opened.</li>
 * <li>{@link JMXConnectionNotification#CLOSED}: The connection with the
 * underlying MBeanServer was closed.</li>
 * <li>{@link JMXConnectionNotification#FAILED}: The connection with the
 * underlying MBeanServer failed - and can no longer be used.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Implementations that support transparent reconnection could only emit
 * {@link JMXConnectionNotification#OPENED} and
 * {@link JMXConnectionNotification#CLOSED} notifications. Implementations that
 * do not support transparent reconnection could emit all three notifications.
 * An implementation providing connections to a local MBeanServer could emit
 * none of them.
