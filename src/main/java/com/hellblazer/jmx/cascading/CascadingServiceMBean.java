/**
 * The <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt> is a high level service MBean that makes
 * it possible to remotely configure <tt>CascadingAgents</tt>. This MBean makes
 * it possible to <i>mount</i> a partial view of a <i>source MBeanServer</i>
 * known by its <tt>JMXServiceURL</tt> into the <i>target MBeanServer</i> of
 * this <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt>.
 * <p>
 * The target <tt>MBeanServer</tt> of a <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt> is
 * usually the <tt>MBeanServer</tt> in which that <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt>
 * is registered. It is recommended to instantiate at most one
 * <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt> per target MBeanServer. If no
 * <tt>ObjectName</tt> is specified when registering the
 * <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt>, then the <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt> will
 * supply its own default name: <tt>{@link #CASCADING_SERVICE_DEFAULT_NAME 
 * CASCADING_SERVICE_DEFAULT_NAME}=new
 * ObjectName("com.sun.jdmk:type=CascadingService")</tt>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the JMX Connection with a source MBeanServer fails, the
 * <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt> will emit a {@link JMXConnectionNotification}
 * with the following parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <var>type</var> is <tt>{@link #CASCADING_FAILED_NOTIFICATION 
 *     "com.hellblazer.jmx.cascading.failed"}</tt></li>
 * <li>The <var>source</var> is the <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt>.</tt></li>
 * <li>The <var>connectionId</var> is the <var>mountPointID</var> that was
 * returned by the the {@link #mount mount} method</li>
 * <li>The <var>userData</var> is the source <tt>JMXConnectionNotification</tt></li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the cascading is unmounted ({@link #unmount unmount} was called) then the
 * <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt> will emit a {@link JMXConnectionNotification}
 * with the following parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <var>type</var> is <tt>{@link #CASCADING_FAILED_NOTIFICATION 
 *     "com.hellblazer.jmx.cascading.stopped"}</tt></li>
 * <li>The <var>source</var> is the <tt>CascadingServiceMBean</tt>.</tt></li>
 * <li>The <var>connectionId</var> is the <var>mountPointID</var> that was
 * returned by the the {@link #mount mount} method</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> In this implementation, the {@link #mount mount} operation does
 * not perform any checks with regards to the coherency of the supplied
 * <var>targetPath</var>. It is under the responsibility of the application to
 * conform to the rules documented in
 * {@link com.hellblazer.jmx.cascading#The_File_System_Analogy

 * "The File System Analogy".
