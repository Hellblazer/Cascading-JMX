    <title>Proxy-based cascading over JMX[tm] Remote API Connectors</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Provides the classes that implement 
    proxy-based cascading over JMX Remote API connectors.

    The generic features of cascading agents are described in the
    {@link com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading} package description.
    The classes provided in this package are the low level implementation
    classes on which relies the {@link 
    com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading.CascadingService}. You should not have
    to use these classes directly.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The <tt>com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading.proxy</tt> package provides 
      a concrete proxy-based implementation of the {@link 
      com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading.CascadingAgent} called 
      {@link com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading.proxy.ProxyCascadingAgent}.
      The <tt>ProxyCascadingAgent</tt> is a <tt>CascadingAgent</tt> that, 
      for each source MBean cascaded from the source <tt>MBeanServer</tt> 
      registers in the target <tt>MBeanServer</tt> a {@link 
      com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading.proxy.CascadingProxy} MBean. 
      The <tt>CascadingProxy</tt> is a simple {@link 
      javax.management.DynamicMBean} that acts as a proxy for the source 
      MBean it is tied to.</p>
    
    <p>For more information on cascading, see the description of the
      {@link com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading} package, and the 
      {@link com.sun.jdmk.remote.cascading.CascadingService} MBean.</p>
